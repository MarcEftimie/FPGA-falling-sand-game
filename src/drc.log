CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net GAME_STATE_CONTROLLER/CELLS_NEXT_STATE/read_address is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin GAME_STATE_CONTROLLER/CELLS_NEXT_STATE/read_address_reg[18]_i_2/O, cell GAME_STATE_CONTROLLER/CELLS_NEXT_STATE/read_address_reg[18]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 GAME_STATE_RAM/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin GAME_STATE_RAM/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[15] (net: GAME_STATE_RAM/ADDRARDADDR[15]) which is driven by a register (GAME_STATE_CONTROLLER/CELLS_NEXT_STATE/FSM_sequential_state_reg_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#2 Warning
