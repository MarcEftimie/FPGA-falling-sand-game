INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/marc/projects/FPGA_Falling_Sand_Game/src/Basys-3-Master.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/falling_sand_game_top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/falling_sand_game_top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 GAME_STATE_RAM/ram_reg_0_0 has an input control pin GAME_STATE_RAM/ram_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[15] (net: GAME_STATE_RAM/ram_reg_7_1_1[15]) which is driven by a register (GAME_STATE_CONTROLLER/CELLS_NEXT_STATE/base_address_reg_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.

It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
